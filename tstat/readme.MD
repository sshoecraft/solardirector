For most people, a comfortable indoor environment features a temperature between 68-72°F (20-22°C) and a relative humidity of 30-50%. 

ASHRAE Standards specify ideal comfort ranges of 68º to 74º at 40% to 60% relative humidity in the winter months and 73º to 79º at 40% to 60% relative humidity in the summer months.
