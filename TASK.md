# SolarDirector Task Tracking

## Current Tasks

### ðŸ”¨ Active Development
- **macOS Compilation Support** - 2025-06-05
  - âœ… Fixed Makefile CPU count detection for macOS (using sysctl)
  - âœ… Added macOS platform detection and configuration to Makefile.sys
  - âœ… Identified root cause of undefined symbols (library architecture mismatch)
  - âœ… Created troubleshooting guide for macOS compilation issues
  - ðŸ”„ **NEXT STEP**: Test library rebuild process on macOS arm64

### ðŸ“‹ Backlog

#### High Priority
- **Cross-Platform Build System**
  - âœ… Improve Makefile.sys for better platform detection  
  - âœ… Add macOS-specific library paths and flags
  - Document platform-specific build requirements

#### Medium Priority
- **Documentation Updates**
  - âœ… Create troubleshooting guide for common build issues
  - Update README.md with macOS build instructions
  - Document agent configuration examples

#### Low Priority
- **Code Quality**
  - Review agent code for consistency
  - Standardize error handling patterns
  - Add more detailed logging capabilities

## Completed Tasks
- **Makefile macOS CPU Detection** - 2025-06-05: Fixed /proc/cpuinfo issue by using sysctl on macOS
- **macOS Platform Configuration** - 2025-06-05: Added macOS target support to Makefile.sys with Homebrew/MacPorts paths
- **Issue Analysis and Documentation** - 2025-06-05: Identified missing symbols root cause and created fix guide

## Discovered During Work
- **Missing Symbol Implementations** - 2025-06-05
  - `_js_FileClass` and `_js_InitFileClass` missing from JavaScript library on arm64
  - `_tmpdir` symbol missing from common library  
  - **Root Cause**: Libraries compiled for wrong architecture (likely x86_64 instead of arm64)
- **Library Architecture Issues** - 2025-06-05
  - JavaScript library may not be compiled for arm64 architecture
  - SD library also needs rebuilding for Apple Silicon
  - Duplicate library linking warning (-lsd-js-mqtt-influx appears twice) - minor issue
- **Build Process Dependencies** - 2025-06-05
  - Libraries must be built in correct order: js â†’ sd â†’ agents
  - Clean rebuilds required when switching architectures
  - Need to verify external dependencies (paho.mqtt.c, gattlib) are also arm64

## Next Steps for User
1. Try the clean rebuild process outlined in `docs/macos-compilation-fix.md`
2. Verify library architectures using `file` command
3. Report back if issues persist for further debugging

## Task Guidelines
- Add new tasks with brief description and date
- Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks" section with completion date
- Use priority levels: High, Medium, Low
- Include any blocking dependencies or requirements
- Add discovered sub-tasks under "Discovered During Work"
