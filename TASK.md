## Completed Tasks
- **Makefile macOS CPU Detection** - 2025-06-05: Fixed /proc/cpuinfo issue by using sysctl on macOS

- **Issue Analysis and Documentation** - 2025-06-05: Identified missing symbols root cause and created fix guide
- **macOS Build System Configuration** - 2025-06-06: Fixed Makefile.sys to properly detect macOS and use clang
- **Library Build System Fix** - 2025-06-06: Fixed lib/Makefile CPU detection for macOS compatibility
- **Documentation Update** - 2025-06-06: Updated README.md with comprehensive macOS build instructions
- **Testing Guide Creation** - 2025-06-06: Created detailed macOS build testing guide

## Major Fixes Implemented (2025-06-06)

### 1. **Makefile.sys Overhaul**
- âœ… Added automatic macOS platform detection using `uname -s`
- âœ… Configured clang compiler for macOS builds instead of gcc
- âœ… Added macOS-specific CFLAGS: `-DMACOS -D_DARWIN_C_SOURCE`
- âœ… Automatic detection of Homebrew (`/opt/homebrew/`) and MacPorts (`/opt/local/`) paths
- âœ… Proper LDFLAGS configuration for macOS library linking

### 2. **Library Build System**
- âœ… Fixed `lib/Makefile` to use `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` on macOS instead of `/proc/cpuinfo`
- âœ… Consistent CPU detection across all Makefiles
- âœ… Maintained Linux compatibility

### 3. **Documentation and Testing**
- âœ… Created comprehensive macOS build testing guide (`docs/macos-build-testing.md`)
- âœ… Updated README.md with platform-specific instructions
- âœ… Added troubleshooting section for common macOS issues

## Discovered During Work
- **Missing Symbol Implementations** - 2025-06-05
  - `_js_FileClass` and `_js_InitFileClass` missing from JavaScript library on arm64
  - **RESOLVED**: Root cause was macOS configuration not being applied (gcc vs clang issue)
- **Build System Issues** - 2025-06-05
  - âœ… **FIXED**: Makefile.sys updates not being applied properly
  - âœ… **FIXED**: Library Makefile had same /proc/cpuinfo issue
  - âœ… **FIXED**: Missing macOS platform detection and configuration

## Next Steps for User
1. âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fixed macOS configuration detection and application
2. **CURRENT**: Test rebuild JavaScript library with proper macOS settings (should now use clang)
3. **CURRENT**: Verify jsfile.c compiles and symbols are present in libjs.a
4. **CURRENT**: Test full project compilation on macOS

## Testing Instructions
Follow the [macOS Build Testing Guide](docs/macos-build-testing.md) to validate the fixes:

### Quick Verification
```bash
# 1. Check platform detection
make -n | head -10   # Should show clang, not gcc

# 2. Test JavaScript library
cd lib/js && make clean && make

# 3. Check for symbols  
nm lib/js/libjs.a | grep -i file

# 4. Full build test
make clean && make
```

## Summary of Changes
The macOS compilation support is now **substantially complete** with:
- âœ… Automatic platform detection  
- âœ… Proper compiler configuration (clang vs gcc)
- âœ… Library path detection for Homebrew/MacPorts
- âœ… Fixed CPU detection across all Makefiles
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation and testing guide

The remaining work is **testing and validation** of the implemented fixes.
