# SolarDirector Task Tracking

## Current Tasks

### ðŸ”¨ Active Development
- **macOS Compilation Support** - 2025-06-05
  - âœ… Fixed Makefile CPU count detection for macOS (using sysctl)
  - âœ… Added macOS platform detection and configuration to Makefile.sys
  - âœ… Identified root cause of undefined symbols (library architecture mismatch)
  - âœ… Created troubleshooting guide for macOS compilation issues
  - âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fixed macOS configuration not being applied - 2025-06-06
  - âœ… **COMPLETED**: Fixed library Makefile CPU detection for macOS - 2025-06-06
  - ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**: Test JavaScript library compilation with new macOS settings

### ðŸ“‹ Backlog

#### High Priority
- **Cross-Platform Build System**
  - âœ… Improve Makefile.sys for better platform detection  
  - âœ… Add macOS-specific library paths and flags
  - âœ… Fix library build system for macOS compatibility
  - Document platform-specific build requirements

#### Medium Priority
- **Documentation Updates**
  - âœ… Create troubleshooting guide for common build issues
  - Update README.md with macOS build instructions
  - Document agent configuration examples

#### Low Priority
- **Code Quality**
  - Review agent code for consistency
  - Standardize error handling patterns
  - Add more detailed logging capabilities

## Completed Tasks
- **Makefile macOS CPU Detection** - 2025-06-05: Fixed /proc/cpuinfo issue by using sysctl on macOS
- **macOS Platform Configuration** - 2025-06-05: Added macOS target support to Makefile.sys with Homebrew/MacPorts paths
- **Issue Analysis and Documentation** - 2025-06-05: Identified missing symbols root cause and created fix guide
- **macOS Build System Configuration** - 2025-06-06: Fixed Makefile.sys to properly detect macOS and use clang
- **Library Build System Fix** - 2025-06-06: Fixed lib/Makefile CPU detection for macOS compatibility

## Discovered During Work
- **Missing Symbol Implementations** - 2025-06-05
  - `_js_FileClass` and `_js_InitFileClass` missing from JavaScript library on arm64
  - **RESOLVED**: Root cause was macOS configuration not being applied (gcc vs clang issue)
- **Build System Issues** - 2025-06-05
  - âœ… **FIXED**: Makefile.sys updates not being applied properly
  - âœ… **FIXED**: Library Makefile had same /proc/cpuinfo issue
  - **Next**: Verify JavaScript library compiles correctly with new settings

## Next Steps for User
1. âœ… **COMPLETED**: Check if Makefile.sys updates are being applied
2. Test rebuild JavaScript library with proper macOS settings (should now use clang)
3. Verify jsfile.c is being compiled into libjs.a with correct symbols
4. Test full project compilation on macOS

## Recent Changes Made (2025-06-06)
- **Makefile.sys**: Added automatic macOS platform detection, configured clang compiler, added Homebrew/MacPorts library paths
- **lib/Makefile**: Fixed CPU detection to use sysctl on macOS instead of /proc/cpuinfo

## Task Guidelines
- Add new tasks with brief description and date
- Move completed tasks to "Completed Tasks" section with completion date
- Use priority levels: High, Medium, Low
- Include any blocking dependencies or requirements
- Add discovered sub-tasks under "Discovered During Work"
