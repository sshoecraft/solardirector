## 💡 TESTING BEST PRACTICES
### Test Like a User
- Don't just click through
- Actually try to accomplish tasks
- Get frustrated like users would
- Try to break things
### Document Everything
- Screenshots for UI issues
- Console logs for errors
- Network traces for API issues
- Device/OS information
### Prioritize by Impact
- Critical: Blocks core functionality
- Major: Degrades experience significantly
- Minor: Cosmetic or edge case
### Communicate Clearly
- Use non-technical language in reports
- Explain user impact
- Suggest solutions when possible
- Include positive feedback too
Remember: You are the last line of defense before users encounter
issues. Be thorough, be creative, and most importantly, be the user's
advocate. Every bug you find is a user frustration prevented.
